## GEM Generation & Barcoding

- GEM: Gel bead-in EMulsions

- Partition single cells, nuclei, or gDNA.

- Objective: one GEM = one cell.

## GEM Generation & Barcoding

Gel beads coated with oligonucleotide barcodes.

  + TruSeq primer (fixed)

  + UMI barcode (unique, per bead)

  + 10x barcode (fixed, per bead)

  + A Poly(dT) tail (fixed)

# Empty droplets and doublets

Cells are loaded in a limiting dilution on the 10x Chromium controller, so that:

- Most GEMs do not contain any cell.

- Most of the GEMs that do contain a cell, contain a single cell.

- The rate of GEMs that contain doublets (or more) is as small as technically possible.

# Exercise

## Import scRNA-seq data and create a Seurat object

- Load the `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("Seurat")` package.

- Use the function `Read10X()` to import data in the `filtered_feature_bc_matrix/` directory in an object named `read10x_data`.
  What class of object does the function return?

- Have a look at the object and its structure.
  What is a sparse matrix and how does it store data?

- How many features and barcodes (i.e., cells) are present in the data set?

- Create a Seurat object from the object `read10x_data`.
  Include features detected in at least 3 cells,
  and cells where at least 200 features detected.
  Name the project `pbmc5k`.
  How many features and cells are left in the Seurat object?

- Poly(dT)VN captures RNA molecules.

- Additional capture sequences for other targets.

- Targets must be barcoded with a complementary oligonucleotide.
