# What are containers?

## What are containers?

- Consistent, reproducible environments.
- Bundles of code, libraries, and dependencies.
- Secure environments separated from data on the host system.

## Multiple containers isolate software on a single host

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Illustration of multiple containers on a single host (Source: Kevin Rue)."
knitr::include_graphics("img/containers-draft-02-slide-05.svg")
```

## Reproducible Research

- Contains all code dependencies including operating system dependencies.
- Can reproduce exact environment of different systems.
- Conda only reproduces installed software but has OS dependencies.
