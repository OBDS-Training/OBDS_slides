```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('BiocManager)
```

Then, they can install Bioconductor packages using the BiocManager package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("limma")
```

Note that `BiocManager::install()` can also install CRAN packages.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("tidyverse")
```

There is a trick to install Bioconductor packages using base R functions.

- In their `.Rprofile`, add:

```{r}
options(repos = BiocManager::repositories())
```

- Then, they can install packagess from both Bioconductor and CRAN using non-Bioconductor functions such as `install.packages()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("limma")
```
