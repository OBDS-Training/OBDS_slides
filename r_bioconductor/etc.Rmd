  Run some code from the "Examples" section of the help page, and describe what the function does.

- Access the package vignette(s).
  How many vignette does the package include?

- Import sequences in the file `TruSeq3-PE-2.fa`.

## BSgenome packages

- Load the package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("BSgenome")`.

- Use the function `BSgenome::available.genomes()`.
  What does it do?

- Load the package `BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.masked`.

- Assign the genome object provided in the package to a new object called `genome`.

An E-box (enhancer box) is a DNA response element found in some eukaryotes that acts as a protein-binding site and has been found to regulate gene expression in neurons, muscles, and other tissues.

The E-box motif is `"CANNTG"`.

- Extract the sequence of chromosome Y from the `genome` object above.

- Find out the appropriate method in the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("Biostrings")` and count the number of E-box motifs present on chromosome Y.

# Metadata columns

`GRanges` is one of many classes that derive from the Bioconductor virtual class `Vector`.

- Virtual classes cannot be instantiated into objects.

- They are used to define slots and methods that be will passed down the inheritance path to all classes that derive from this virtual class.

The virtual class `Vector` defines two slots:

- `metadata`, to store metadata related to the entire object.

- `elementMetadata`, to store metadata for each element in the vector; accessed using `mcols()`.

# Exercise

## rtracklayer

- Download the GTF file for human gene sets from <https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html>

- Import the file in your <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> session using the function `rtracklayer::import()`.

# Annotation packages and biomaRt

Packages dedicated to query annotations exist in the `Software` and `Annotation` categories of [biocViews](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html).

- The `r BiocStyle::Biocannopkg("biomaRt")` package provides an interface to the [Ensembl BioMart](https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview) data repository.

- A collection of annotation packages provide most of that information for several model organisms.

# Exercise

## Annotation packages

Each annotation package contains a database of information.

The `OrgDb` family of packages provide annotations that link several types of identifiers for genes, proteins, and pathways (e.g. KEGG, Gene Ontology).

- Load the package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("org.Hs.eg.db")`.

Each `OrgDb` package contains an object of the same name as the package.

- What is the class of the object?
- Use the `columns()` method to discover which sorts of annotations can be extracted
from the object.
- Use the `keytypes()` method to discover which columns can be used to query information.
- Use the `keys()` method to get the first six gene symbols in the database.
  Store as `human_symbols`.
- Use the `AnnotationDbi::select()` method to fetch the Entrez and Ensembl identifiers for those gene symbols.
  + What happens if you do not specify `AnnotationDbi`?
- Use the `mapIds()` method to get the Ensembl identifier for those gene symbols.

---

# Exercise

## biomaRt

- Load the package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("biomaRt")`.
- Use the `listMarts()` function to list the BioMart databases to which the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("biomaRt")` package can connect.
- Use the `listEnsemblArchives()` function to lists the available archived versions of Ensembl.
- Use the `useMart()` function to create an object named `mart` using the `"ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL"` BioMart database and set the host option to `"https://may2021.archive.ensembl.org"`.
  Why would one do that in practice?
- Use the `listDatasets()` function to list the datasets available in the selected BioMart database.
  What is the identifier of the database that contains information for _Homo sapiens_?
- Use again the `useMart()` function to replace the `mart` object by a new one that points to information for _Homo sapiens_.
- Use the `listAttributes()` function to list the fields of information available in the dataset.
- Use the `getBM()` function to fetch the chromosome, start and end positions, and strand for the gene symbols that you stored as `human_symbols`.

# EnsDb packages

The `EnsDb` family of packages provide annotations that encapsulate individual versions of the Ensembl annotations in Bioconductor packages.

- Once the package is installed, annotations are available locally, without the need to query the online Ensembl backend.

- The series of packages seems to have end at Ensembl version 86 (!)

- Bioconductor annotation packages share the `BiMap` class, meaning that functions like `columns()`, `keytypes()`, and `mapIds()` work in the same way for the different types of annotation packages.

> Use the function `slotNames()`.

- Which slots of the `DESeqDataSet` object can access using accessor functions (e.g. `assays()`) ?
  Do all of those accessors work on the original `demo_se` object?

## SingleCellExperiment

The class name `SingleCellExperiment` is only a name.
While developed with single-cell genomics in mind, it is not limited to that use.
Remember that classes are simply defined by their slots and methods.
If the slots and methods are suitable to store and process another type of data, then go for it!

- Load the package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("SingleCellExperiment")`.

- Convert your earlier `demo_se` to a `SingleCellExperiment` object, using the `as()` function.
  Call the object `demo_sce`.

- Display the object.
  What additional information can the `SingleCellExperiment` class store, relative to the `SummarizedExperiment` class?

- Use the methods `reducedDimNames()`, `reducedDims()`, and `reducedDim()` on the object `demo_sce`.
  What do they do?

- **Bonus point:** Use the method `reducedDim()` to store a new dimensionality reduction matrix called `"PCA"` in the object.
  Display and inspect the updated object.

# Final advice

## Choosing a package

With so much choice, it can be difficult to decide which package to try first.

- Go by popularity (e.g., biocViews, download stats, word of mouth)

  + More users $\rightarrow$ more chance to find help, online and around you.

- Read and manually run code in the package vignette(s).

  + A good package that makes sense to you is better than an expert package that feels obscure.
  
## Getting help

- <https://support.bioconductor.org/>

  + Public and searchable: asked once, answered once (avoid emails!).
  
  + MRE: Minimal reproducible example (e.g., use demo object in help page).

## BiocManager repositories

Bioconductor packages can be installed and managed using base R function such as `install.packages()` with a minimum additional setup.

- Run `options("repos")`.

The function `options()` can be used to get or set global options of the current <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> session.

- Run `BiocManager::repositories()`.

The function reports the URLs from which to install Bioconductor and CRAN packages.

- In an `.Rprofile` file -- either in your home directory or in the root of your RStudio project -- add the following line and restart the <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> session.

```{r, include=TRUE}
options(repos = BiocManager::repositories())

## Import SummarizedExperiment objects using tximeta

- Load the packages `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("tximeta")` and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("tximportData")`.

The help page of the `tximeta()` function refers to an example output of the Salmon program that is installed on your computer at `system.file("extdata/salmon_dm/SRR1197474/quant.sf", package="tximportData")`.

- Navigate to that location in the file explorer of your respective operating system, and examine its contents, in a text editor or your terminal application.

- Run the rest of the example code, and discuss the use of a linked transcriptome with `tximeta` (set `write=TRUE` instead of using the example code as-is, call the file `tximeta.json`, and read the help page of `makeLinkedTxome()`).

- What other types of quantification programs does `tximeta` support?
  Where do you find that information?
