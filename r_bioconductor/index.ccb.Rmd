# Exercise

## BiocManager

On the CCB cluster, all the packages required for the course are already installed.
As a result, you do not need (and should not) install any package yourself.

> Instead, you should ask the CCB system administrators to install or update packages for you.

To give you an idea, what the system administrators did essentially comes down to:

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("Biostrings")
```

The package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("BiocManager")` is the only official Bioconductor package on CRAN.
It provides functions to install, update, and more generally manage your library of Bioconductor (and CRAN) packages.

The function `BiocManager::install()` can install packages from Bioconductor, CRAN, and even GitHub.
Here, we demonstrate it with a single package name.
However, it was used to install a whole set of Bioconductor packages and their dependencies.

- Run the function `BiocManager::valid()`.
  What does it do?
