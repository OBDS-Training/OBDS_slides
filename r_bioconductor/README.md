# Introduction to Bioconductor

<!--
This title should match exactly the link in the main README.
-->

## Instructor(s)

<!--
Instructors should be listed in the order:
- Speaker
- Helper
-->

- Kevin Rue-Albrecht (@kevinrue)
- Charlie George (@Charlie-George)

## Lesson goals and objectives

<!--
Refer to:
https://github.com/Bioconductor/BioC2019/blob/master/docs/workshop-syllabus.md#a-note-about-learning-goals-and-objectives-bloom
https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/
-->

### Learning goals

<!--
High-level "big picture" objectives of the learning process.
This should be no more than 3 bullet points.
-->

- Describe the Bioconductor project beyond software packages.
- Identify classes and methods re-used across Bioconductor packages.
- Identify  best practices to get help from packages developers and peers.

### Learning objectives

<!--
More concrete and measurable outputs.
This can range from 3 to 8 bullet points.
-->

- Bookmark online website where help can be found.
- Install core Bioconductor packages and workflow specific packages.
- Create Bioconductor objects and access their contents.

## Pre-requisites

<!--
May be a combination of:
- Requirements asked from participants before the day.
- Links to other OBDS course days with goals or objectives feeding in this day.
-->

- A clone of the shared GitHub repository for this course.
- A working installation of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (4.1).
- A working installation of [git](https://git-scm.com/).
- A working installation of [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/).

## Data sets

<!--
Ideally, links to data sets that participants must download.
Even better, we add a page to this repository, that lists all data sets used; and this section links to some of those data sets.
Realistically, a list describing data sets that we will make them download on the day.
