# Prerequisites

- An account on the teaching cluster.

- A [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub](https://github.com/) repository for this course.

## Lessons

- Introduction to base <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>.

- Introduction to `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("ggplot2")`.

---

# Set up

- Launch RStudio Server on the teaching cluster.

- Start a new RStudio project called `dimensionality_and_clustering`.

- Make a copy of the template notebook for this lesson in your <i class="fab fa-git"></i> repository.

- Make symbolic link from the RStudio project to the template notebook.

- Open the notebook and follow along, editing and running the code as needed.

# Exercise

## BiocManager

On the teaching cluster, all the packages required for the course are already installed.
As a result, you do not need (and should not) install any package yourself.

> Instead, you should ask the system administrators to install or update packages for you.

To give you an idea, what the system administrators did essentially comes down to:

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("Biostrings")
```

The package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("BiocManager")` is the only official Bioconductor package on CRAN.
It provides functions to install, update, and more generally manage your library of Bioconductor (and CRAN) packages.

The function `BiocManager::install()` can install packages from Bioconductor, CRAN, and even GitHub.
Here, we demonstrate it with a single package name.
However, it was used to install a whole set of Bioconductor packages and their dependencies.

- Run the function `BiocManager::valid()`.
  What does it do?
