# Exercise

## Exploring software packages

- Visit the listing of packages on the Bioconductor [biocViews](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html) web page.

- Use the `Autocomplete biocViews search` box in the upper left to identify packages that have been tagged for RNA sequencing analysis.

- Explore other analysis like ChIP-seq, epigenetics, variant annotation, proteomics, single-cell genomics, etc.

- Explore the graph of software packages by expanding and contracting individual terms.

- In the RNA-seq category, find out which of `DESeq2` and `edgeR` is more popular, and go to their landing page.

- Briefly explore the vignette and reference manual links.

# Exercise

## Exploring annotation packages

- Visit the listing of packages on the Bioconductor [biocViews](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html) web page.

- Click on the `AnnotationData` top-level term.

- Search, using the box on the right-hand side, for annotation packages that start with the following letters to get a sense of the packages and organisms available.

  + `org.`: symbol mapping
  + `TxDb.` and `EnsDb.`: gene models
  + `BSgenome.`: reference genomes

## Exploring workflow packages

Workflow packages are meant to provide a comprehensive introduction to workflows that require several different packages.
These can be quite extensive documents, providing a very rich source of information.

- Briefly explore the ‘Simple Single Cell’ workflow (or other workflow relevant to your domain of interest) to get a sense of the material the workflow covers.

# The Bioconductor philosophy

- Common data structures

  + e.g., `DNAStringSet`, `GRanges`, `GAlignments`, `SummarizedExperiment`, `TxDb`

  + High standards of software engineering; [Core team](https://www.bioconductor.org/about/core-team/).

  + Reduce redundancy; Promotes interoperability.

  + ..., but community adoption can take time.

--

- Release cycle every 6 months (April, October)

  + Packages on the _release_ branch are stable for at least 6 months.
    Active development takes place on the _devel_ branch.
  
  + ..., but new features can take up to 6 months to be released (_devel_ $\rightarrow$ _release X.Y_).

--

- New packages are thoroughly reviewed by members of the core team

  + Packages are submitted as issues on <i class="fa fa-github"></i> [Bioconductor/Contributions](https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions)
  
  + Review and fixes can take time, but accepted packages are generally high quality!

- Install the `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("BiocManager")` package from CRAN.

- Install the package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("Biostrings")` using `BiocManager::install()`.

- Run the function `BiocManager::valid()`.
  What does it do?

## Use Bioconductor packages and help pages

- Load the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("Biostrings")` package.

- The `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("Biostrings")` package provides the object `DNA_ALPHABET`.
  Print the object in the console and use the help page to explain the contents of the object.

- The `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("Biostrings")` package provides the function `letterFrequency()`.
  Run some code from the "Examples" section of the help page, and describe what the function does.

- Access the package vignette(s).
  How many vignette does the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("Biostrings")` package include?

- Import sequences in the file `TruSeq3-PE-2.fa`.

# Exercise

## BiocManager repositories

- Run `options("repos")`.
  What do you see?

The function `options()` can be used to get or set global options of the current <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> session.

- Run `BiocManager::repositories()`.

The function returns a character vector that combines the URL of Bioconductor package repositories with those already present in `options("repos")`.

- In the `.Rprofile` file, add the following line and restart the <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> session.

```{r, include=TRUE}
options(repos = BiocManager::repositories())
```

- Run `options("repos")` again in your freshly opened <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> session.
  What do you see now?

- The `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("BSgenome")` package provides core functionality.

- Other package names start with `"BSgenome."`

  + e.g. `BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19`
]

---

# Exercise

## BSgenome packages

- Install the package `BSgenome`.

- Use the function `BSgenome::available.genomes()`.
  What does it do?

- Install and load the package `BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.masked`.

- Assign the genome object provided in the package to a new object called `genome`.

An E-box (enhancer box) is a DNA response element found in some eukaryotes that acts as a protein-binding site and has been found to regulate gene expression in neurons, muscles, and other tissues.

The E-box motif is `"CANNTG"`.

- Extract the sequence of chromosome Y.

- Count the number of E-box motifs present on chromosome Y using the appropriate method available in the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("Biostrings")` package.

# Accessing core information in GRanges

The functions `seqnames()`, `start()`, and `end()` access the components of the same name.

.pull-left[
```{r, include=TRUE}
seqnames(demo_granges)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include=TRUE}
start(demo_granges)
end(demo_granges)

Chromosome names are conceptually similar to factors;
a `GRanges` object often contains many ranges on each chromosome.
The function `seqlevels()` returns the list of unique chromosome names in the object (including levels that may not be present in a subset).

```{r, include=TRUE}
seqlevels(demo_granges)
```

---

# Metadata columns

`GRanges` is one of many classes that derive from the Bioconductor virtual class `Vector`.

- Virtual classes cannot be instantiated into objects.

- They are used to define slots and methods that be will passed down the inheritance path to all classes that derive from this virtual class.

The virtual class `Vector` defines two slots:

- `metadata`, to store metadata related to the entire object.

- `elementMetadata`, to store metadata for each element in the vector; accessed using `mcols()`.

.pull-left[
```{r, include=TRUE}
mcols(demo_granges)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include=TRUE}
demo_granges$metadata1
metadata(demo_granges)
```
]

---

# Bioconductor has its own DataFrame class

.pull-left[
For example, take the metadata columns of the `demo_granges` object.

.small-code[
```{r, include=TRUE}
demo_dataframe <- mcols(demo_granges)
demo_dataframe
```
]

The `DataFrame` itself could potentially have some metadata columns.

.small-code[
```{r, include=TRUE}
mcols(demo_dataframe)
```
]

Let's add some.

.small-code[
```{r, include=TRUE}
mcols(demo_dataframe) <- DataFrame(a = c(1))
```
]
]

.pull-right[
Note that a `DataFrame` object does not show its metadata like a `GRanges` does, but they do exist inside the object.

.small-code[
```{r, include=TRUE}
demo_dataframe
mcols(demo_dataframe)
```
]

What happens if we run the following? Why?

.small-code[
```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mcols(demo_dataframe) <- DataFrame(a = c(1, 2))

# rtracklayer

.pull-left[
```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/biocviews-annotation.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
- The package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("rtracklayer")`  was developed as an extensible framework for interacting with multiple genome browsers

  + e.g., UCSC

- To that end, it also provides functionality for manipulating annotation tracks in various formats (currently  and 2bit built-in)

  + e.g., GFF, BED, bedGraph, BigWig
]

---

# Exercise

## rtracklayer

- Download the GTF file for human gene sets from <https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html>

- Install and load the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("rtracklayer")` package.

- Import the file in your <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> session using the function `rtracklayer::import()`.
  Assign the object to the variable name `gtf_data`.

- What are the metadata columns available in the object?

- Subset the annotations to the gene `ACTB`.

- How many transcripts do the annotations describe for that gene?

- Subset the annotations to exons, and split by transcript.
  What is the class of the object that is returned?

# Annotation packages and biomaRt

Packages dedicated to query annotations exist in the `Software` and `Annotation` categories of [biocViews](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html).

- The `r BiocStyle::Biocannopkg("biomaRt")` package provides an interface to the [Ensembl BioMart](https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview) data repository.

- A collection of annotation packages provide most of that information for several model organisms.

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/biocview-annotations-human.png")
```

---

# Exercise

## Annotation packages

Each annotation package contains a database of information.

The `OrgDb` family of packages provide annotations that link several types of identifiers for genes, proteins, and pathways (e.g. KEGG, Gene Ontology).

- Install and load the package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("org.Hs.eg.db")`.

Each `OrgDb` package contains an object of the same name.

- What is the class of the object?

- Use the `columns()` method to discover which sorts of annotations can be extracted
from the object.

- Use the `keytypes()` method to discover which columns can be used to query information.

- Use the `keys()` method to get the first six gene symbols in the database.
  Store as `human_symbols`.

- Use the `select()` method to fetch the Entrez and Ensembl identifiers for those gene symbols.

- Use the `mapIds()` method to get the Ensembl identifier for those gene symbols.

---

# Exercise

## biomaRt

- Install and load the package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("biomaRt")`.

- Use the `listMarts()` function to list the BioMart databases to which the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("biomaRt")` package can connect.

- Use the `listEnsemblArchives()` function to lists the available archived versions of Ensembl.

- Use the `useMart()` function to create an object `mart` using the `"ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL"` BioMart database and set the host `"https://may2021.archive.ensembl.org"`.
  Why would one do that in practice?

- Use the `listDatasets()` function to list the datasets available in the selected BioMart database.
  What is the identifier of the database that contains information for _Homo sapiens_?

- Use again the `useMart()` function to replace the `mart` object by a new one that points to information for _Homo sapiens_.

- Use the `getBM()` function to fetch the chromosome, start and end positions, and strand for the gene symbols that you stored as `human_symbols`.
  Use `listAttributes()` to identify field names to fetch.

---

# EnsDb packages

The `EnsDb` family of packages provide annotations that encapsulate individual versions of the Ensembl annotations in Bioconductor packages.

- Once the package is installed, annotations are available locally, without the need to query the online Ensembl backend.

- The series of packages seems to have end at Ensembl version 86 (!)

- Bioconductor annotation packages share the `BiMap` class, meaning that functions like `columns()`, `keytypes()`, and `mapIds()` work in the same way for the different types of annotation packages.

```{r}
options(width = 130)
```

What does the code above do?
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include=TRUE,}
demo_se
```

- Use the methods `assays()`, `assayNames()` `assay()`, `colData()`, `rowData()`, `mcols()` and `metadata()` on the object `demo_se`.

What do those functions do?

## Import SummarizedExperiment objects using tximeta

- Install and load the packages `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("tximeta")` and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("tximportData")`.

The help page of the `tximeta()` function refers to an example output of the Salmon program that is installed on your computer at the location returned by the code `system.file("extdata/salmon_dm", package="tximportData")`.

- Navigate to that location in the file explorer of your respective operating system, and examine its contents.

- Run the rest of the example code, and discuss the use of a linked transcriptome with `tximeta` (set `write=TRUE` instead of using the example code as-is, call the file `tximeta.json`, and read the help page of `makeLinkedTxome()`).

- What other types of quantification programs does `tximeta` support?
  Where do you find that information?

# Exercise

## SummarizedExperiment extensions

- Install and load the package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("DESeq2")`.

- Convert your earlier `demo_se` to a `DESeqDataSet` object, using the `as()` function.

- What are the slots of information present in the `DESeqDataSet` object?

- Which slots are new compared to the `SummarizedExperiment` object?

- Which slots of the `DESeqDataSet` object can access using accessor functions (e.g. `assays()`) ?
  Do all of those accessors work on the original `demo_se` object?

## SingleCellExperiment

The class name `SingleCellExperiment` is only a name.
While developed with single-cell genomics in mind, it is not limited to that use.
Remember that classes are simply defined by their slots and methods.
If the slots and methods are suitable to store and process another type of data, then go for it!

- Install and load the package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("SingleCellExperiment")`.

- Convert your earlier `demo_se` to a `SingleCellExperiment` object, using the `as()` function.
  Call the object `demo_sce`.

- Display the object.
  What additional information can the `SingleCellExperiment` class store, relative to the `SummarizedExperiment` class?

- Use the methods `reducedDimNames()`, `reducedDims()`, and `reducedDim()` on the object `demo_sce`.
  What do they do?

- Use the method `reducedDim()` to store a new dimensionality reduction matrix called `"PCA"` in the object.
  Display and inspect the updated object.

# The ExperimentHub package and resources

The `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ExperimentHub")` package provides a portal to a large collection of preprocessed datasets available directly as Bioconductor objects.

The package can be used to query, search, and filter the list of available datasets, before downloading and importing those of interest into your <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> session.

```{r}
options(width = 80)
```

.pull-left[
.x-small-code[
```{r, include=TRUE}
library(ExperimentHub)
ehub <- ExperimentHub()
query(ehub, c("SingleCellExperiment"))
```
]
]

.pull-right[
.x-small-code[
```{r, include=TRUE}
eh1433 <- ehub[["EH1433"]]
eh1433
```
]
]

# Description of a dataset in the ExperimentHub

A single pair of square brackets `[]` shows information about a given identifier, while a double pair `[[]]` downloads the dataset and imports the object.

.small-code[
```{r, include=TRUE}
ehub["EH1433"]
```

## Interactive visualisation using iSEE

<a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEE/"><img src="img/isee-sticker.png" alt="iSEE sticker" align="bottom" height="90px"></a> is a package that leverages the reliable stability of the `SummarizedExperiment` data structure - and its extensions - to produce an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for visualisation of the object contents.

- Install and load the package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("iSEE")`.

- Use the `iSEE()` function on the `SingleCellExperiment` object `eh1433`.

- Install and load the packages `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scuttle")` and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scater")`.

- Compute and add a PCA result to the object `eh1433`.

- Launch the `iSEE` GUI again.
  What changed?
