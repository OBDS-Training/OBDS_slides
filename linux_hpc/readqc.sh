## Specify a partition. Check available partitions using sinfo Slurm command.

## The following line will send an email notification to your registered email
## address when the job ends or fails.
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL

## Specify the amount of memory that your job needs. This is for the whole job.
## Asking for much more memory than needed will mean that it takes longer to
## start when the cluster is busy.
#SBATCH --mem=500MB

## Specify the number of CPU cores that your job can use. This is only relevant for
## jobs which are able to take advantage of additional CPU cores. Asking for more
## cores than your job can use will mean that it takes longer to start when the
## cluster is busy.
#SBATCH --ntasks=2

## Specify the maximum amount of time that your job will need to run. Asking for
## the correct amount of time can help to get your job to start quicker. Time is
## specified as DAYS-HOURS:MINUTES:SECONDS. This example is one day.
#SBATCH --time=0-01:00:00

## Provide file name (files will be saved in directory where job was ran) or path
## to capture the terminal output and save any error messages. This is very useful
## if you have problems and need to ask for help.
