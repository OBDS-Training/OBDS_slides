# Lesson goals and objectives

## Learning goals

- Understand the concept of object-oriented programming.

- Describe how to access the contents of an S3 object.

- Identify methods that behave differently for objects of different classes.

- Develop good practices to name objects and functions in your <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> workspace.

## Learning objectives

- Create objects of various classes.

- Inspect their contents.

- Apply methods to objects of various classes.

# Prerequisites

<br/>

.x-large-list[
- A clone of the shared GitHub repository for this course.

- A working installation of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (4.0.3).

- A working installation of [git](https://git-scm.com/).

- A working installation of [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/).
]

---

# Set up

- Pull the `master` branch of the shared repository.

> We have added some files to get you started.

- In the daily sub-directory, make a copy of the `template` sub-directory with your HPC username.

> e.g. `cp -R template kevinrue`

The resulting file structure should look like the following:

```
  OBDS_Training_May_2021/
  |_ 3_r_genomics_data_science/
    |_ 1_oop/
      |_ template
        |_ ... (files)
      |_ kevinrue (copied from 'template')
        |_ ... (files)
        |_ oop.Rproj
```

- Launch the RStudio project `oop.Rproj` in your sub-directory.

# So far, in the course

## Procedural programming

- So far we have been using functions

- This is but one type of programming paradigm

- Divide and conquer

- Readable

- Sustainable

- Easier to debug

- Reuse code

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

.pull-left[
## Why Object Oriented Programming?

- Better code reusability
- Better security mechanisms
- More flexibility and scalability
]

.pull-right[
## In procedural programming:

- Decompose the problem into sub-problems
- Write _functions_ for each sub-problem
- Task oriented

## In object-oriented programming:

- Focus on _data_ rather than logic
- Use _objects_ / _classes_ to model real-world concepts
- Objects can communicate with each other
