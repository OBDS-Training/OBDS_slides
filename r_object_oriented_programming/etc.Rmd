# Procedural programming

We often see programming as applying functions to variables in our workspace.
This is but one type of programming paradigm.

- Divide and conquer.

- Reuse code.

- Readable?

- Sustainable?

- Easier to debug?

However:

- New tasks, new types of inputs, new combinations of inputs and arguments, ...

  + Complexity grows.

- New functions require new function names.

```

- Data are stored in _objects_ that undergo successive transformations.
- Different _classes_ of objects are designed to contain different data types.
- Functions specialised in the handling of certain classes are called _methods_.

---

# Classes: the cornerstone of OOP

- _Classes_ represent the generic definition of real-world objects.

- _Objects_ are instances of classes representing individual examples.

- Class _attributes_ store data specific to individual objects.

- Class _methods_ are functions specialised in manipulating class attributes.

- Classes often have hierarchical (and nested) relationships.

# Objects are instances of a class

- A _class_ is the generic description of an object
  
  + Like a recipe for a dish; or an entry in a dictionary.

- An _object_ is an instance of that class

  + Like one specific plate of food serve on a table.

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

.pull-left[
## In procedural programming:

- Decompose the problem into sub-problems.
- Write _functions_ for each sub-problem.
- Task oriented.

## In object-oriented programming:

- Focus on _data_ rather than logic.
- Use _objects_ / _classes_ to model real-world concepts.
- Objects can communicate and interact with each other.
]

.pull-right[
## Why Object Oriented Programming?

- Better code reusability.
- Better security mechanisms.
- More flexibility and scalability.

Note: Individually described in next few slides

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| polymorphism | refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. |
| Encapsulation | describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit, e.g., a class. |
| Inheritance | is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods. |
| abstraction | refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation (e.g. someone driving a car doesn't need to know how an engine works -> API) |

# Encapsulation

- Attributes and methods are bundled together in objects.

- Users interact with objects through their public methods.

- In turn, public methods perform the requested action using private attributes and methods.

# Inheritance

- Child classes inherit all the attributes and methods of their parent class(es).

- Child class can add their own new attributes and methods.

# Abstraction

- Expose only high-level methods.

- Keep details of low-level implementation internal.

- As a result, the private methods and attributes can be changed without affecting users.

- Do not overwhelm users with more information than they need to be aware of.

# Polymorphism

-  Attributes and public methods can be implemented differently for different classes and sub-classes.

# Now, the sad news ...

- We've just described the _theory_ of object-oriented programming (OOP).

- There are _many_ implementations of OOP. Sometimes multiple implementations for the same programming language!

- <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> has no less than _three_ implementations of OOP:

  + S3, the original class system in base <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>.
  
  + S4, implemented in the `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("methods")` package.
  
  + R6, implemented in the `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("R6")` package.

In this lesson, we focus on S3, to understand classes of objects that we frequently come across in base <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>.

# The S3 class system in <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>

Everything is an object in <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>.
For example, character vectors are objects.

.pull-left[
```{r, include=TRUE}
character_object <- "A"
character_object
str(character_object)
class(character_object)
attributes(character_object)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include=TRUE}
character_object2 <- c("A", "B", "C")
character_object2
str(character_object2)
class(character_object2)
attributes(character_object2)
```
]

---

# Factors are objects, too

.pull-left[
```{r, include=TRUE}
factor_object <- factor(c("A", "B", "C"))
factor_object
str(factor_object)
class(factor_object)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include=TRUE}
attributes(factor_object)
attr(factor_object, "levels")
attr(factor_object, "class")
```
]

---

# Data frames are objects

.pull-left[
```{r, include=TRUE}
dataframe_object <- data.frame(
  numbers = c(1, 2, 3),
  strings = c("A", "B", "C")
  )
dataframe_object
class(dataframe_object)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include=TRUE}
str(dataframe_object)
attributes(dataframe_object)
```
]

---

# And matrices are objects

.pull-left[
```{r, include=TRUE}
matrix_object <- matrix(
  data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8),
  nrow = 2
  )
matrix_object
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include=TRUE}
class(matrix_object)
str(matrix_object)
attributes(matrix_object)
attr(matrix_object, "dim")
```
]

# S3 method dispatch

Methods are ordinary functions that use a special naming convention: `generic.class`:

.pull-left[
```{r}
options(width = 60)
```

```{r, include=TRUE}
methods("print") %>% head(14)
```

**Note:** this is why it is bad practice to use the character `.` in the name of objects and custom functions.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, include=TRUE}
print.factor(factor_object)
print.factor(character_object)
print.default(character_object)
```
]

.center[
**You can call methods directly, but you shouldn't!**Instead, `print(object)`.
]

The whole point of method dispatch is that <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> uses the class of the object to determine the method to use.

# Summary

## Key points

- <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> implements no less than three systems for object-oriented programming (OOP).

- The S3 class system is the original implementation of classes in base <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>.

- _S3 classes_ are nothing more than ordinary <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> objects (e.g., `vector`, `list`) with at least an attribute named `class` that indicate the name of the class(es) as a character vector.

- _S3 methods_ are nothing more than ordinary <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> functions named following the convention `generic.class` (e.g., `print.factor`)

- Calling `print(factor_object)` will invoke the `print.factor` method if `factor_object` is an object of class `factor`.
