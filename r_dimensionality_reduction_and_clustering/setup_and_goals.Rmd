# Learning objectives

## Learning goals

- Describe dimensionality reduction and clustering methods.

- Explain the difference between dimensionality reduction and clustering.

- Learn how to use those methods as part of analytical workflow in R.

## Learning objectives

- Apply dimensionality reduction methods to data; visualise and compare results.

- Identify and visualise features contributing most to principal components.

- Apply clustering methods to data; visualise and compare results.

- Integrate clustering and dimensionality reduction results for visualisation.
