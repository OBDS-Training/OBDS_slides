### Learning goals

<!--
High-level "big picture" objectives of the learning process.
-->

- Describe dimensionality reduction and clustering methods.
- Explain the difference between dimensionality reduction and clustering.
- Learn how to use those methods as part of analytical workflow in R.

### Learning objectives

<!--
More concrete and measurable outputs.
-->

- Apply dimensionality reduction methods to data; visualise and compare results.
- Identify and visualise features contributing most to principal components.
- Apply clustering methods to data; visualise and compare results.
- Integrate clustering and dimensionality reduction results for visualisation.
