# Learning Goals & Objectives

### Learning goals

<!--
High-level "big picture" objectives of the learning process.
-->

- Understand what version control is and when to use it.
- Identify where git stores information.
- Practice how to record changes in git.

### Learning objectives

<!--
More concrete and measurable outputs.
-->

- Set up an SSH key pair on GitHub.
- Configure Git.
- _Clone_ your own copy of the shared repository for this course.
- Edit files and _commit_ your changes.
- _Push_ your contributions to the shared repository.
- _Pull_ contributions from other participants in the shared repository.
- Examine the _log_ of the shared repository.

---

# Pre-requisites

- A [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

- Membership to the <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub organisation [OBDS-Training](https://github.com/OBDS-Training) .

- An account on the CCB cluster.

_We need to set an SSH key pair between RStudio Cloud and GitHub._
]

---

# Exercise

## Setting up the SSH key pair

This key pair will allow your RStudio Cloud project to push and pull code through the GitHub API.

- In your RStudio Cloud project, open the Terminal.

- Create an SSH key pair.

  + `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`
  
  + _Do_ set a passphrase to protect your key pair.

- Display the public key and copy it.

  + `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

- Add the public key to your GitHub account.

  + <https://github.com/settings/ssh/new>

# Exercise

## Setting up a GitHub Personal Access Token

The following slides illustrate how to navigate to the page below more naturally.

- Navigate to <https://github.com/settings/tokens/new>.

- Set note to "OBDS January 2022".

- Leave expiration to 30 days. _Do not_ tick any of the boxes.

- Generate the token and copy it.

- Back on the CCB cluster, create a file called `.Renviron` in your home directory:

  + In the R console, type `file.edit("~/.Renviron")`.
  
- In that file, add the line `GITHUB_PAT="<paste token here>"`.

- Restart the R sesion, and check that the environment variable is set.

  + In the menu bar: "Session" > "Restart R", and in the R console: `Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT")`.

# Using <i class="fab fa-git"></i> as an HPC module

Use SSH to open a terminal on the HPC cluster.

The system executable of `git` on your default `PATH` is a rather old version.
What is the path to the system `git`?
What version of `git` is it?

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ which git
$ git --version
```

Instead, we will use the `module` command to put a more recent version of `git` on our `PATH`.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ module avail git
$ module load git/2.31.1
```

Examine your `PATH` variable, the path to the new `git` executable, and the version of this new `git` executable.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ which git
$ git --version
```

---

# Getting started with <i class="fab fa-git"></i>

The `git` command has many sub-commands, options, and flags.
You can run `git` alone to list the sub-commands and a short description of each.
How many sub-commands do you see?

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git
```

The `--version` flag asks `git` to print the version of the `git` executable that is used.
The <i class="fab fa-git"></i> program is generally backward compatible, but you may observe subtle differences in the way different version of <i class="fab fa-git"></i> display information.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git --version
```

You can access more detailed help for any sub-command using the `--help` flag.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git clone --help
```
