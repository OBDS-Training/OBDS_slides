# GitHub Personal Access Tokens

When installing packages directly from GitHub, you may run into this type of error.

```
> remotes::install_github("immunogenomics/lisi")
Downloading GitHub repo immunogenomics/lisi@master
Error: HTTP error 403.
  API rate limit exceeded for 151.181.86.126. (But here's the good news: Authenticated
  requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the documentation for more details.)

  Rate limit remaining: 0
  Rate limit reset at: 2018-10-16 15:23:35 UTC
```

What is happening:

- GitHub limits the number of anonymous queries to its API.

- A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) authenticates the requests (i.e., it identifies the user who made the request).

- Authenticated requests have a higher rate limit.
