## Lesson goals and objectives

<!--
This lesson is essentially the skeleton of the linux course.
We will present the genomics workflow done usually on linux and the subsequent 
days would be about learning and doing each step of the workflow while learning 
skills needed for that (e.g. version control, working on cluster using conda 
environments).
So the main goal in this lesson is to give them a shallow but comprehensive 
picture of the linux course. We can talk about this while presenting the 
learning goals and objectives below, highlighting at which point they are and 
then just present detail objectives or outline per talk.
Take care not to make this part very long, overwhelming them on the 1st day!

### Learning goals

<!--
High-level "big picture" objectives of the learning process.
This should be no more than 3 bullet points.
-->

- Understand the value of working with the Linux command line for genomics
- Learn to work with the Linux command line

### Learning objectives

<!--
More concrete and measurable outputs.
This can range from 3 to 8 bullet points.
-->

- Familiarise with the genomics workflow often done on the Linux command line
- Use basic Linux commands and syntax
