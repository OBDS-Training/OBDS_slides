# Genomics on the Linux command Line: Introduction to the Linux command line

<!--
This title should match exactly the link in the main README.
-->

## Data sets

<!--
Ideally, links to data sets that participants must download.
Even better, we add a page to this repository, that lists all data sets used; and this section links to some of those data sets.
Realistically, a list describing data sets that we will make them download on the day.

## Log for completed round and task list for next round

### 2023 Sep - Liezel

- Schedule 
  + Delayed Talk 1 start due to WIMM IT accounts needing to be setup so just allot time for this
  + Had to start 2nd half of talk 2 (intro to linux part 2) after lunch
  + Finished talk but did not have time for to discuss exercises
   
### 2024 Jan - Liezel

General
- [ ] Change exercises to add resources symbolics links to working directory early on to make next exercises easier
- [ ] Discuss with group how to store shared resources
- [ ] Change SSH config and key pair location and approach as detailed in Day 1 README.md
- [ ] For both Day 1 and Day 2, maybe allow more time for doing the commands than listening to lecture
- [ ] Remove $ before lecture code
- [ ] Put exercises right after talk? Hard to do in qmd while synchronising exercises on slides and solution
- [ ] Emphasise thought process when building commands
- [ ] Emphasise that hash can be used to comment out text

Lesson
- [ ] Adjust schedule based on slide content adjustments
- [ ] Maybe move SSH config and key pair to Day 1 but make it like Conda or Mamba installation written on GitHub that they can follow, do it with them and make sure everyone has completed it, this way logging into the cluster is easier in terms of typing
- [ ] Make sure to explain sequencing terms in Talk 1 (Genomics workflow in Linux)
