# Genomics on the Linux command Line: Introduction to the Linux command line

<!--
This title should match exactly the link in the main README.
-->

## Data sets

<!--
Ideally, links to data sets that participants must download.
Even better, we add a page to this repository, that lists all data sets used; and this section links to some of those data sets.
Realistically, a list describing data sets that we will make them download on the day.

## Linux Day 1 setup/reminders (first 30 minutes)

- Slack channel
- Give link to OneDrive folder with materials
- Check for Windows users and check if Git Bash installed
- Show slide with 
  + WIMM IT account activation instructions
  + Instructions to email IT help desk to get access to WIMM VPN service and point to instructions to get access to WIMM VPN service which they can do during free time

## Log for completed round and task list for next round

### 2023 Sep - Liezel

- Schedule 
  + Delayed Talk 1 start due to WIMM IT accounts needing to be setup so just allot time for this
  + Had to start 2nd half of talk 2 (intro to linux part 2) after lunch
  + Finished talk but did not have time for to discuss exercises
   
### 2024 Jan - Liezel

General
- [x] Change exercises to add resources symbolics links to working directory early on to make next exercises easier
  + Removed paths, give it on the day as Kevin does
- [x] Discuss with group how to store shared resources
- [ ] Change SSH config and key pair location and approach as detailed in Day 1 README.md
- [x] For both Day 1 and Day 2, maybe allow more time for doing the commands than listening to lecture
- [x] Remove $ before lecture code
  + Keep $ to different command from output of command in slides
- [x] Put exercises right after talk? Hard to do in qmd while synchronising exercises on slides and solution
  + Separate lecture and exercise pdf so they can open both at the same time and put side by side
- [x] Emphasise thought process when building commands
- [x] Emphasise that hash can be used to comment out text
- [x] Simplify lecture, talk less and give more time for exercises!

Lesson
- [ ] Adjust schedule based on slide content adjustments
- [ ] Maybe move SSH config and key pair to Day 1 but make it like Conda or Mamba installation written on GitHub that they can follow, do it with them and make sure everyone has completed it, this way logging into the cluster is easier in terms of typing
- [x] Make sure to explain sequencing terms in Talk 1 (Genomics workflow in Linux)
  + Removed line mentioning peak calling, atac-seq etc to avoid confusion and avoid using time to discuss these methods
