## Linux shell - Terminology alert!

<!-- 
Nice explanation in https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/command-line-for-beginners/
-->

- Linux is an Operating System (OS), like MS Windows and macOS, but open source and **FREE**! 
- All OS have a  **shell** i.e. a command-line interpreter
  + It processes the commands, giving them to the OS and outputs the results
- There are different shells differing in syntax and characteristics
- Most widely used shell for Linux is **BASH** (Bourne Again Shell)
- The **terminal** or **command-line interface**, where user inputs commands, is used to interact with the shell
  + The command-line prompt (input field) is indicated by a certain character depending on OS ($ for Linux)

## Linux commands

- Types
  + **Shell builtin** - Built into the shell itself
  + **Executable program** - Any external software in the system path (where OS looks for executables)
  + **Alias** - User-defined command built using other commands
  
```
$ type <command name>             # ‘type’ shows type of command

$ type cd                    
cd is a shell builtin

$ type less
less is /usr/bin/less

$ which <command name>            # ‘which’ returns the path of the file to be executed
$ which less
/usr/bin/less
```
## Linux command options

- Commands have options that modify their functions
- Main parts of a command
  + \<command> -\<options> \<argument>

```
$ which less
less is /usr/bin/less

$ which -a less                  # '-a' to print all matching paths of each argument
/usr/bin/less
/bin/less
```

## Getting help with linux commands

- Different ways
  + ‘man’ command displays manual pages
  + <command name> --help
  + Google search!
