### Learning goals

<!--
High-level "big picture" objectives of the learning process.
-->

- Identify statistical distributions and tests available in R.
- Learn to use statistical distributions and tests in R.
- Describe how to interpret the result of statistical tests.
- Understand how to visualise data in the context of statistical testing.

### Learning objectives

<!--
More concrete and measurable outputs.
-->

- Query built-in statistical distributions.
- Perform statistical tests.
- Interpret test results.
- Apply multiple testing correction.
- Visualise data and test results.
