### Learning goals

<!--
High-level "big picture" objectives of the learning process.
-->

- Identify statistical distributions and tests available in R.
- Learn to use statistical distributions and tests in R.
- Describe how to interpret the result of statistical tests.
- Understand how to visualise data in the context of statistical testing.

### Learning objectives

<!--
More concrete and measurable outputs.
-->

- Query built-in statistical distributions.
- Perform statistical tests.
- Interpret test results.
- Apply multiple testing correction.
- Visualise data and test results.

## Pre-requisites

<!--
May be a combination of:
- Requirements asked from participants before the day.
- Links to other OBDS course days with goals or objectives feeding in this day.
-->

- An account on the CCB cluster or [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/).
- Alternatively, a working installation of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (4.1.2) and [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
