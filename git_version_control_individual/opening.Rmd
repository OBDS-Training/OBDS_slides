- Try various ideas.

- Track additions and deletions to a base document.

- Undo and re-apply changes.

- Integrate contributions from multiple authors.

- Backup important work.

- Manage and resolve conflicting changes.

- Go back to any version at any time.

**What do _you_ expect from a tool to track changes?**

# Track changes

## Microsoft Word

```{r, out.height='350px', out.width='500px'}
# Source: https://medium.com/jumpto365/sharepoint-version-history-isnt-track-changes-fae1b71754ea
knitr::include_graphics("img/microsoft-word-track-changes.png")
```

Other examples:
Google Docs [version history](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en),
LibreOffice [Recording and Displaying Changes](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Recording_and_Displaying_Changes).

# Track changes using version control

## Example on a single file

```{r, fig.align='center', out.height='200px'}
# Source: https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/01-basics/index.html
knitr::include_graphics("img/carpentries-play-changes.svg")
```

#### Process

- Initialise the base version of the document.
- Make changes to the document.
- Take snapshots of the document at key moments.
- Annotate those snapshot with a description of the changes.

#### Result

- You can examine the history of changes and restore any snapshot of the document.

# Tracking simultaneous changes to multiple files 

```{r, fig.align='center', out.height='250px', out.width='800px'}
# In-house illustration made using Adobe Illustrator
knitr::include_graphics("img/commit-multiple-files.svg")
```

#### Process

- Add each file to the next set of changes (i.e., _staging area_).
- Then, add this set of changes to the repository (i.e., _commit_).

#### Result

- That set of changes is recorded as a single unit in the repository.
- Undoing or playing back these changes applies all the changes simultaneously.
- It is _not_ possible to undo or play back these changes in one file independently from the other files.

## Git Clones

- Each contributor has a copy (i.e., _clone_) of the repository on their own computer.

- Commits are first made locally.

- Commits can then be _pushed_ and _pulled_ from one clone to another.

- Remote repositories must be accessible through a public URL to interact with them.
]

## Note

- Clones do not communicate automatically with each other; they are not always synchronised.

- Contributors generally interact with a "central" repository online (e.g., GitHub); not directly with each other's clone.

# Summary

- A _repository_ is a directory on a computer in which files are tracked.

- Files in a repository are tracked: changes are detected and recorded.

- Users decide when changes are recorded.

  + Each record of changes is called a _commit_.

- The complete history of _commits_ makes up the history of a _repository_.

- A _repository_ can be _cloned_ and synchronised across different computers (i.e. _remotes_).

# The Long History of Version Control Systems

## A brief summary

Tools like [RCS](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/rcs.git), [CVS](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cvs), or [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) have been around since the early 1980s and are used by many large companies.

However, many of these are now considered legacy systems (i.e., _outdated_) due to various limitations in their capabilities.

More modern systems, such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), are _distributed_, meaning that they do not need a centralized server to host the repository.
