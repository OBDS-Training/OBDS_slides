# Learning Goals & Objectives

### Learning goals

<!--
High-level "big picture" objectives of the learning process.
-->

- Understand what version control is and when to use it.
- Identify where git stores information.
- Practice how to record changes in <i class="fab fa-git"></i>.

### Learning objectives

<!--
More concrete and measurable outputs.
-->

- Set up an SSH key pair.
- Configure <i class="fab fa-git"></i>.
- _Initialise_ a personal repository for this course, on <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub.
- _Clone_ a copy of the repository on the teaching cluster.
- Create and edit files in the repository on the teaching cluster, and _commit_ those changes.
- _Push_ your changes to the <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub clone of the repository.
- Edit files on the <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub clone of the repository.
- _Pull_ updates from the <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub clone to the clone of the repository on the teaching cluster.
- Examine the _log_ of the shared repository, on <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub and on the teaching cluster.

---

# Pre-requisites

- A [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

- An account on the teaching cluster.

---

# Set up

- Connect to the University VPN.

- Open a terminal application on your computer.

- Connect to the teaching cluster over SSH.

_We need to set an SSH key pair between the teaching cluster and <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub._

# Exercise

## Setting up the SSH key pair

This key pair will allow your clone of the repository to push and pull code through the <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub API.

- In the Terminal application, logged in the teaching cluster, create an SSH key pair.

  + `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`
  
  + Accept the default location for the key (leave field empty and press the Return key)
  
  + _Do_ set a passphrase to protect your key pair.

- Display the public key and copy it.

  + `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

- Add the public key to your <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub account.

  + <https://github.com/settings/ssh/new>

# Exercise

## Clone the repository

The `git clone` sub-command takes the address of a remote repository and creates a copy of that repository in a new local directory.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git clone git@github.com:kevinrue/OBDS_May_2022.git
```

.pull-left[
```{r, fig.align='center', out.height='300px'}

knitr::include_graphics("img/git-clone-collaboration.svg")
```
]

.pull-right[
But first, create a `git` subdirectory in your personal OBDS directory and change directory.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
mkdir /project/obds/$USER/git
cd /project/obds/$USER/git
```

Now, clone the repository into that `git` subdirectory.

# Summary so far

- You have _initialised_ a repository (with a `README.md` file) on <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub.

- You have made a _clone_ of the repository on the teaching cluster.

- You have _committed_ changes to files on the teaching cluster.

- You have _pushed_ those commits from the teaching cluster to <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub.

- You have _committed_ changes to files on <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub.

- You have _pulled_ those changes from <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub to the teaching cluster.

.pull-right[
Adding, committing, and pushing/pulling changes cover 99% of the <i class="fab fa-git"></i> commands you will use.

However, you need to be aware of other <i class="fab fa-git"></i> commands to manage and undo mistakes.
