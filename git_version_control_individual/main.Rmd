# The `.git` subdirectory

Change directory to your new local clone of the repository, and list its contents.
For instance:

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ cd OBDS_May_2022
$ ls -a
```

```
.  ..  .git  README.md
```

Git uses the `.git` sub-directory to store all the information about the project history.
You can have a brief look for yourself if you wish.
Make sure that you do not alter or remove anything in that sub-directory.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ ls -a .git/
```

#### Result

- Deleting the `.git` sub-directory is effectively discarding the _history_ of changes made to the repository.
- However, deleting the `.git` sub-directory does not affect the _current state_ of the other sub-directories and files that make up your project (e.g., `README.md`).

.center[
**Changes are stored separately from the files themselves.**

# Ignore files

One or more special files named `.gitignore` can be placed in your project.

Each line in those file specifies a file name or pattern that <i class="fab fa-git"></i> will ignore (i.e., not track) in the future.

- Files that are already tracked will continue to be tracked even after they are added to `.gitignore`, unless they are explicitly removed from the repository using `git rm` (use the `--cached` option to only remove the file from the index, but keep the file itself).

.pull-left[
## .gitignore
```
 .DS_Store
 data/
 *fastq.gz
 *sam
 *bam
```

**Can you tell which files will be tracked when this `.gitignore` exists in the project root directory?**

.pull-right[
```

# Status of a repository

The `git status` sub-command can be used to check whether the repository is up-to-date.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

# Exercise

## Make changes

Create a file named `.gitignore` in your repository
using the `nano` command line text editor in the Bash terminal:

```bash
nano .gitignore
```

Add a commented line to that file, starting with `#` (hashtag), e.g.

```
# This file list file patterns to ignore from version control
```

Run `git status` again.

# Untracked files

Here is an example output of `git status`, after adding a new file `.gitignore`.

```
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

---

# Track new files

The `git add` sub-command can be used to add new sets of changes to the _staging area_.

- The _staging area_ is used to prepare the set of changes that will be recorded in the next _commit_.
- The command adds filenames to the staging area, but only the changes in those files will be recorded.
- In this case, we add a new file to the staging area, so the whole contents of the new file constitute the changes (relative to no file).

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git add .gitignore
$ git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   .gitignore
```

.center[
**What changed in `git status` after running `git add`?**

# The staging area

We just ran `git add`, which added a set of changes to the _staging area_.

Then, we ran `git status`, as it is always a good idea to inspect the state of the repository to ensure everything is as expected before taking any further action.

The `git commit` sub-command can be used to add changes currently in the _staging area_ in the next _commit_ of the _repository_.

- The contents of the _staging area_ are added to a new _commit_ in the repository.
- The _staging area_ itself is cleared, ready for the next set of changes to process.

```

---

# Record a set of changes 

The `git commit` sub-command can be used to record the changes that are currently in the _staging area_ in the next _commit_ of the _repository_.

- The `-m` option can be used to specify the message used to annotate the _commit_ that will contain this set of changes. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git commit -m "Added .gitignore file"
```

```
[main 81acf15] Added .gitignore file

---

# Remotes

You have made a _commit_ in the clone of the repository on the teaching cluster.

- The <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub clone of the repository does not about it yet.

- You need to _push_ those updates from the teaching cluster to <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.height='300px', out.width='800px'}
# Source: Kevin Rue-Albrecht (Adobe Illustrator)
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-push.svg")
```

The histories of clones are not automatically synchronised.

.center[
**Can you guess reasons why?**
]

# Push commits to a remote

The `git push` sub-command can be used to send local changes to a remote repository.

- The local repository must have configured the address of the remote repository.
- When you create a repository as a _clone_ of a remote repository,
  this is done automatically (the remote `origin` is created during initialisation).

Before we push, the `git remote` command can be used to inspect, add, and remove remote repositories from the local repository configuration.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git remote -v
```

```
origin	git@github.com:kevinrue/OBDS_May_2022.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:kevinrue/OBDS_May_2022.git (push)
```

When everything is in place, you can tell <i class="fab fa-git"></i> to push new commits from the local clone to a remote.
When calling `git push` without any other argument,
the default is to push from the current branch to the corresponding branch on the remote named `origin`.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
$ git push
```

---

# Exercise

## Push commits to a remote

- Run `git push`.

Alternatively, we could have used the following command to explicitly push
(the current branch) to the branch called `main` on the remote called `origin`
(for the same result).

```
git push origin main

# The repository history

The `git log` sub-command can be used to display the history of commits in the repository.

- The `--all` option forces <i class="fab fa-git"></i> to display the repository history across all the branches.
  + By default, <i class="fab fa-git"></i> only displays the history of the branch currently checked out.
- The `--graph` option adds a visual representation of branches in the repository, and their connections to each other.
- The `--oneline` (i.e., "one line") forces <i class="fab fa-git"></i> to summarise each commit as a single line.
  + This limits the information displayed, but helps with the visualisation.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# View differences between commits

The `git diff` sub-command can be used to compare two states of the repository.

- It is possible to compare all the changes between a reference and a target commits using the syntax `git diff reference_commit target_commit`
  + The order of commit identifiers control the changes that are shown as "added" or "removed".
- It is also possible to compare the current state of files in the repository - including uncommitted changes - to any commit of the repository.
  + This is often used to examine the changes that you have made since the most recent commit.

# Edit files on <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub

Files can be created and edited directly on <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub,
though only one file can be edited at a time in this way.
Saving the changes creates a new commit on <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub.

## Exercise

On <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub, navigate to the file `README.md`,
and click the pencil above the file on the right.
