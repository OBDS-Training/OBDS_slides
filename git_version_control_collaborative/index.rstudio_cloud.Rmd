# Exercise

## Setting up an RStudio Cloud project

This RStudio Cloud project will be your workplace for the course.

- Navigate to <https://rstudio.cloud/> and sign in.

- Create a new RStudio project

  + "New Project" > "New RStudio Project".

  + _Do not_ use "New Project from Git Repository".

- Name the project "OBDS_Training_Jan_2022".

_We need to set an SSH key pair between RStudio Cloud and GitHub._
]

---

# Exercise

## Setting up the SSH key pair

This key pair will allow your RStudio Cloud project to push and pull code through the GitHub API.

- In your RStudio Cloud project, open the Terminal.

- Create an SSH key pair.

  + `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`
  
  + _Do_ set a passphrase to protect your key pair.

- Display the public key and copy it.

  + `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

- Add the public key to your GitHub account.

  + <https://github.com/settings/ssh/new>

# Exercise

## Setting up a GitHub Personal Access Token

The following slides illustrate how to navigate to the page below more naturally.

- Navigate to <https://github.com/settings/tokens/new>.

- Set note to "OBDS January 2022".

- Leave expiration to 30 days. _Do not_ tick any of the boxes.

- Generate the token and copy it.

- Back in your RStudio Cloud project, create a file called `.Renviron` in your home directory:

  + In the R console, type `file.edit("~/.Renviron")`.
  
- In that file, add the line `GITHUB_PAT="<paste token here>"`.

- Restart the R sesion, and check that the environment variable is set.

  + In the menu bar: "Session" > "Restart R", and in the R console: `Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT")`.
