	abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

	abstract = {g:Profiler ( https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler ) is a widely used gene list functional profiling and namespace conversion toolset that has been contributing to reproducible biological data analysis already since 2007. Here we introduce the accompanying R package, gprofiler2 , developed to facilitate programmatic access to g:Profiler computations and databases via REST API. The gprofiler2 package provides an easy-to-use functionality that enables researchers to incorporate functional enrichment analysis into automated analysis pipelines written in R. The package also implements interactive visualisation methods to help to interpret the enrichment results and to illustrate them for publications. In addition, gprofiler2 gives access to the versatile gene/protein identifier conversion functionality in g:Profiler enabling to map between hundreds of different identifier types or orthologous species. The gprofiler2 package is freely available at the CRAN repository .},
