## Pathway/Gene set (Functional) enrichment analysis 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Gene lists (e.g. from differential expression analysis) are complex and hard to interpret by eye
  + A biological function is often not attributable to a single molecule
- With functional enrichment analysis tools, we can:
  - Get biological meaning/function from a list of genes 
  - Generate/confirm hypothesis from our data

## Terminology

- **Gene set** - Set of related genes, relationship can be defined by different contexts
  + All genes mentioned in a paper
  + All genes involved in a pathway
  
- **Pathway** - Set of genes that work together to carry out a biological process

- Gene set is a more general and less specific concept than pathway but the terms are often used interchangeably

- **ORA** - uses a list of differentially expressed genes as input
- **FCS** - uses the entire matrix of genes as input (e.g. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis method / **GSEA**)
- PT - similar to FCS but additionally uses the number and type of interactions between gene products, which may or may not be available from gene set/pathway databases used by tools

<br/>

- All methods output **list of significant gene sets/pathways in the condition under study**
- <span style="color:green;">Let's focus first on ORA then discuss GSEA in comparison with ORA</span>

# Over representation analysis (ORA)

## ORA workflow

- Determine enrichment of each gene set/pathway (provided by databases) within our input gene list relative to a background gene list

```

## ORA analysis method

1. **Make input list** of differentially expressed genes created using a specified threshold or criteria
   + e.g. upregulated genes with log2 FC > 1 and padj < 0.05
  
2. For each gene set/pathway (provided by databases, e.g. immune response):
   a. Count the number of **genes overlapping and not overlapping** with your (i.) input differentially expressed genes and (ii.) background
   
      ```{r}

      #| out-height: 200px

      knitr::include_graphics("img/fisher-test-table.svg")
      ```
    
   b. **Statistically test for over-representation** of gene sets/pathways in the input list *via* e.g. Fisher's exact (based on hypergeometric distribution) / Chi-squared test -- gives p-value 

3. After all gene sets/pathways are tested, adjust p-values for multiple test correction

## Choosing background gene list

- Think of background as as list of genes that could have been positive or present in your input gene list! 
  + Can exclude from background list genes that are not expressed in the experimental context
  + When restricted to measuring certain types of genes (e.g. immunology / neuroscience genes using targeted expression panels), only include genes of that type in the background

- Important factor because the size and content of background gene lists can change the resulting enrichment p-values for each pathway / gene set
  + It changes the numbers in the previous table

## Databases of gene sets / pathways

- Gene sets and pathways are available from a number of databases
- **[Gene Ontology (GO)](https://geneontology.org)** and **[Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/)** are the most popular and frequently used
  + Long standing curation
  + Availability for wide range of species
  
- Collection of databases used for functional enrichment analysis is tool-specific
  + Tools (e.g. R packages, web-based tools for ORA / GSEA) can either use one or multiple databases
  
- [Example list of gene set databases](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/#libraries)

## Database 1: Gene Ontology (GO)

- GO uses 3 umbrella terms to describe our understanding of biology:
  + Molecular function (MF) - Molecular activities of gene products e.g. catalysis or transport 
  + Cellular component (CC) - Where gene products are active e.g. mitochondrion
  + Biological process (BP) - Pathways and larger processes made up of the activities of multiple gene products e.g. DNA repair

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- 1 GO term ~ 1 gene set

- From these 3 umbrella terms, other GO terms branch out forming a tree-like structure
  + Where edges between terms represent parent-child relationship, 
  + Where 'child' terms are more specific than 'parent' terms

# Exercise - Perform ORA using gprofiler2 

## Advantages of ORA

- Simple, quick and straight forward
- Can be performed with unordered gene lists (unlike GSEA, TBD)

## Limitations of ORA

- Often only uses the most significant genes -- information loss
  + Gene list generated using an arbitrary threshold
  + Some methods overcome this by using an iterative approach that adds one gene at a time to find a set of genes for which a pathway is most significant 
- Equal importance assigned to each gene -- ignores fold changes from DE analysis
- Uses statistical procedures that assume independence among genes
  + Estimated significance of a pathway may be biased or incorrect
- Assumes each pathway is independent of other pathways
  + GO processes are heirarchical
  + Same gene can be present in multiple pathways, so identifying which gene set is the most relevant becomes problematic

- FCS (GSEA) addresses some of these limitations

# Functional class scoring (FCS) 

## FCS workflow

- While large changes in single genes can have significant effects on pathways (detected by ORA)
  + Weaker but coordinated changes in groups of functionally-related genes can also have significant effects 
- FCS can detect these weaker, coordinated changes
- **Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)** is a tool classified under FCS approaches

```

## GSEA analysis method

1. **Make input ranked list** of all genes using a gene-level statistic -- log2 FC
  
2. For each gene set/pathway: 
   a. Calculate an **enrichment score** -- degree to which gene set is over-represented at the top or bottom of a ranked list of gene
   
      ```{r}
      #| fig-align: center
      #| out-height: 200px

      ## Source: custom-made (from Kevin's 'r_stats_pca_clustering' lecture)
      knitr::include_graphics("img/fisher-test-table.svg")
      ```
    
   b. **Statistically test for enrichment** of gene sets/pathways in the input list *via* permutation test -- gives p-value 
   
3. After all gene sets/pathways are tested, adjust p-values for multiple test correction

## Calculation of enrichment score per gene set/pathway

- Test statistic for a gene set/pathway is a running sum or score
  + <insert good image for explanation, maybe use actual output for them to be familiar?>

## Calculation of enrichment score per gene set/pathway

- Null distribution is obtained *via* permutation testing by calculating a running sum many times, resulting into a distribution of test statistic values
  + but each time shuffling the order of genes in the "ranked" list

- P-value is then the probability of getting the test statistic for a gene set/pathway given the null distribution

- Let's try to do GSEA then after that we can discuss the differences between ORA and GSEA

# Exercise - Perform GSEA using fgsea 

## ORA vs. FCS (GSEA)

- Input
- Analysis
- Output

## ORA? GSEA? Both?

## Considerations when choosing ORA/GSEA tools

- Different tools access different databases 
  + Are they regularly updated?
- Interfaces of tool â€“ web versus script?
  + Script allows you more control of settings and version control/reproducibility
- Different tools have different default settings - check 
  + Larger gene sets more likely to be significant ->  cap at ~500 
- Is it well documented/maintained 
- What gene identifiers does it use? 
  + Specificity -> Ensembl >> Entrez >> Gene Symbol
  + Species?

<br>

- Not all ORA tools let you set a custom background gene lists (online especially)
