# Gene set / Pathway enrichment analysis

<!--
This title should match exactly the lecture slides.
-->

## Data sets

<!--
Ideally, links to data sets that participants must download.
Even better, we add a page to this repository, that lists all data sets used; and this section links to some of those data sets.
Realistically, a list describing data sets that we will make them download on the day.

## Log for completed round and task list for next round

### 2023 Oct - Liezel

- Schedule 
  + Differential expression spilled over, started ORA talk around 11am
  + The ORA exercise started from 11:30 to 12:30 then continued from 1:30 to 3 pm inclusive of discussion because I was trying to wait until everyone got a plot of significant pathways, **don't wait for too long and start discussing ORA exercise after lunch** 
  + Started GSEA around 3:15 (after break) and finished talk around 3:40 so I just had to a demo of the exercise
  + I think the content is fine, just adjust the timings, better to still account for DESeq spill over though
   
### 2024 Jan - Liezel

Lesson
- [ ] Add packages for pathway topology
- [ ] Mention a simplified explanation of pathway topology
- [ ] Add best practices when method results are overwhelming

Exercise
- [ ] ORA: Does the gprofiler2 link expire?
- [ ] ORA: Check how to separate outputs per query when doing multi-query
- [ ] Add queue somewhere so you do not forget to discuss the outputs of the functions
