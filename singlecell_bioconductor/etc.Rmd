# Import single-cell data using Bioconductor

The package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("DropletUtils")` provides several utilities for reading and preprocessing single-cell data.

## Import

- `DropletUtils::read10xCounts()` imports 10X Genomics data from the CellRanger output directories.
  It returns a `SingleCellExperiment` object.

## Utilities and quality control

- `DropletUtils::barcodeRanks()` computes barcode rank statistics and identify the knee and inflection points on the total count curve.
- `DropletUtils::emptyDrops()` is designed to distinguish between empty droplets and cells by testing each barcodeâ€™s expression profile for significant deviation from the ambient profile.
- `DropletUtils::swappedDrops()` removes the effects of barcode swapping.
  It takes a list of paths to individual samples and returns a list with an item called `cleaned`, itself a list of sparse matrices, after removing swapped molecules.

---

# Exercise

## Import scRNA-seq data and create a SingleCellExperiment object

- Import the filtered matrix into R; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("DropletUtils")`.

**Note:** use the `samples` argument of the `DropletUtils::read10xCounts()` function to give a convenient name to each sample.
  Check the difference without using the `samples` argument.

- Print the object.
  What can you tell about its contents?

- What can you tell from the object metadata?

**Note:** slots of `SummarizedExperiment` objects are typically accessed using functions of the same name, e.g. `metadata()`.

# Computing metrics for quality control

The package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scuttle")` provides several utilities focused on the preprocessing and quality control of single-cell gene expression data.

## Quality-control

- `scuttle::perCellQCMetrics()` and `scuttle::perFeatureQCMetrics()` compute a variety of quality control metrics for arbitrary sets of cells and features in the dataset (e.g., mitochondrial genes, individual samples), and returns them as columns of a `DataFrame`.

- `scuttle::addPerCellQC()` and `scuttle::addPerFeatureQC()` compute the same metrics, but adds them to the `SingleCellExperiment` object as `colData` and `rowData`, respectively.

## Visualisation

- `scater::plotScater()` and other functions `scater::plot...()` can help you visualise different aspects of the data set.

... but you can also use `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("ggplot2")` to visualise information stored as `DataFrame` in the `colData()` and `rowData()` (Note: you will first need to convert from `DataFrame` to `data.frame` or `tibble`).

---

# Exercise

## Quality control

- Compute and visualise quality control metrics (library size, genes detected, mitochondrial fraction); use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scuttle")` and/or `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scater")`.

  + Identify mitochondrial genes and pass those to the `subsets` argument of the `scuttle::addPerCellQC()` function.

  + What is the return value?
    Where are the quality metrics stored?
    What is the difference with `scuttle::perCellQCMetrics()`?

- Visualise quality metrics (three violin plots); use `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("ggplot2")`.

- Filter cells, keeping those with more than 4,500 UMI, less than 15% mitochondrial UMI, and more than 1,500 genes detected. 

- Similarly, use `scuttle::perFeatureQCMetrics()` or `scuttle::addPerFeatureQC()` to compute per-feature quality metrics, and visualise those metrics.

# Normalisation strategies 

The packages `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scuttle")` and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scran")` host methods for the most common and popular normalisation strategies.

## scuttle

- `scuttle::logNormCounts()` computes log-transformed normalized expression values.
  This includes the computation of size factors using `scater::librarySizeFactors()`.

## scran

- `scran::computeSumFactors()` implements the deconvolution strategy from (Lun et al., 2016).

  + This function is now superseded by `scuttle::computePooledFactors`.

# scran: Deconvoluting size factors from cell pools

.pull-left[
- All cells in the data set are averaged to make a reference pseudo-cell.

- Expression values for cells in pool A are summed together and normalized against the reference to yield a pool-based size factor.

- This is equal to the sum of the cell-based factors and can be used to formulate a linear equation.

- Repeating this for multiple pools leads to the construction of a linear system that can be solved to estimate the size factor for each cell

# Exercise

## Normalisation

- Convert the counts into normalized expression values to eliminate cell-specific biases (e.g., in capture efficiency); use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scater")`.

**Note:** use `scuttle::logNormCounts()` to compute log-normalised counts.
  What is the return value?
  Where can you find the normalised counts?

- Plot the variance against the mean of each gene.

**Note:** how can you tell whether the normalisation was effective?
  Compare with https://osca.bioconductor.org/feature-selection.html#quantifying-per-gene-variation

- When would you rather use `scuttle::computePooledFactors` instead?

---

# Feature selection

The package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scran")` provides methods that form a workflow to identify and select features that display a high amount of biological variance.

- `scran::modelGeneVar()` decomposes the log-expression profiles for each gene into technical and biological components based on a fitted mean-variance trend.

- `scran::getTopHVGs()` uses modelling statistics `scran::modelGeneVar()` to define a set of highly variable genes.

---

# Exercise

## Feature selection

Select features for downstream analyses, e.g. highly variable genes; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scran")`.

- Use `scran::modelGeneVar()` to model the variance of the log-expression profiles for each gene.
  What is the output?

- Visualise the relation between the mean expression of each gene and the total / biological / technical variance of each gene.

How do you interpret those different values?

- Use `scran::getTopHVGs()` to identify highly variable genes.

What is the output?
  How many genes do you identify?
  Where are those genes located in the mean-variance plot?
  What happens to this plot if you set more stringent thresholds to define highly variable genes?

# Dimensionality reduction

The packages `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scater")` and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("BiocSingular")` provide several common dimensionality reduction methods.

Those include:

.pull-left[
- `scater::runPCA()` / `BiocSingular::runPCA()`

- `scater::runTSNE()`

- `scater::runUMAP()`
]

.pull-right[
- `BiocSingular::runSVD()`

- `BiocSingular::runExactSVD()`

- `BiocSingular::runIrlbaSVD()`

- `BiocSingular::runRandomSVD()`
]

## Important notes

- Those methods generally use only a subset most variable features, not the entire dataset.
- By default, `runTSNE()` performs a PCA step first, the result of which the first 50 PCs are used as input for the t-SNE algorithm.
- By default, `runUMAP()` performs a PCA step first, of which the first 50 PCs are used as input into the UMAP algorithm.

---

# Exercise

## Dimensionality reduction

- Apply PCA; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scater")` or `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("BiocSingular")`.

**Note:** only give the set of highly variable genes to the `scater::runPCA()` function, to save time, memory, and to focus on biologically informative genes in the data set.

- Apply UMAP and t-SNE successively on the output of the PCA.

**Note:** UMAP and t-SNE are typically given the output of PCA as their own input, to further reduce the dimensionality for ease of visualisation.

- Visualise the layout of cells produced by each of those dimensionality reduction methods.
  Considering coloring points with quality control metrics.

## Bonus point

- Use `scran::denoisePCA()` to remove principal components that correspond to technical noise, and compare downstream t-SNE or UMAP with those obtained before de-noising.

# Clustering

The packages `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scran")` and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("BiocNeighbors")` provides several methods for clustering single-cell data.
The CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("igraph")` provides powerful methods for graph-based clustering.

- `scran::quickCluster()` clusters similar cells using either log-expression values or ranks.
- `scran::buildSNNGraph()` builds a shared nearest-neighbour graph using cells as nodes.
  For each cell, its $k$ nearest neighbours are identified using the `BiocNeighbors::findKNN()` function, based on distances between their expression profiles (Euclidean by default).
  + The function works on a reduced dimension representation of the dataset, _not_ the gene expression matrix.
  + The output is a graph where nodes are cells and edges represent connections between nearest neighbors.
    To obtain cluster, the graph must still be partitioned using an appropriate function, e.g. `igraph::cluster_louvain()`.

## Example

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
g <- scran::buildSNNGraph(sce, use.dimred = 'PCA')
colData(sce)[["cluster_louvain"]] <- factor(igraph::cluster_louvain(g)$membership)
```

---

# Exercise

## Clustering

Cluster cells using `scran`.

- Start with `scran::getClusteredPCs()` to cluster cells after using varying number of PCs, and pick the number of PCs using a heuristic based on the number of clusters.

- Use `scran::buildSNNGraph()` and `igraph::cluster_louvain()` with that "ideal" number of PCs.
  Assign the cluster label to a cell metadata column named `"label"`.

- Visualise the assigned cluster on your preferred dimensionality reduction layout.

**Note:** Dimensionality reduction and clustering are two separate methods both based on the PCA coordinates.
  They may not always agree with each other, often helping to diagnose over- or under-clustering, as well as parameterisation of dimensionality reduction methods.

## Bonus point

- Test different numbers of principal components and compare results.
- Try `scran::quickCluster()`; identify key parameters and compare results.

# Identifying cluster markers

The package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scran")` provides several methods for identifying cluster markers.

- `scran::findMarkers()` tests for differential expression between pairs of groups.

- `scran::pairwiseTTests()` performs pairwise Welch t-tests between groups of cells, possibly after blocking on uninteresting factors of variation.
  The return value is a list of `DataFrame` - one for each group of cells - that can be examined separately of combined into a single table using `scran::combineMarkers()`.

- `scran::pairwiseWilcox()` and `scran::pairwiseBinom()` provide alternative statistical tests.

---

# Exercise

## Cluster markers

- Use `scran::findMarkers()` to identify markers for each cluster.

- Visualise the expression of selected markers:

  + as a dot plot, optionally with a violin layer.
  
  + on a dimensionality reduction layout.
