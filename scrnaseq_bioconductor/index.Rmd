# Bioconductor - Philosophy

- Common data structures

  + e.g., `DNAStringSet`, `GRanges`, `GAlignemts`, `SummarizedExperiment`, `TxDb`

  + High standards of software engineering; [Core team](https://www.bioconductor.org/about/core-team/).

  + Reduce redundancy; Promotes interoperability.

  + ..., but community adoption can take time (e.g., `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("GSEABase")`)

--

- Release cycle every 6 months (April, October)

  + Packages on the _release_ branch are stable for at least 6 months.
    Active development takes place on the _devel_ branch.
  
  + ..., but new features can take up to 6 months to be released (_devel_ $\rightarrow$ _release_).

--

- New packages are thoroughly reviewed by members of the core team

  + Packages are submitted as issues on <i class="fa fa-github"></i> [Bioconductor/Contributions](https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions)
  
  + Review and fixes can take time, but accepted packages are generally high quality!

# Import single-cell data using Bioconductor

The package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("DropletUtils")` provides several utilities for reading and preprocessing single-cell data.

## Import

- `read10xCounts()` imports 10X Genomics data from the CellRanger output directories.
  It returns a `SingleCellExperiment` object.

## Utilities and quality control

- `barcodeRanks()` ccomputes barcode rank statistics and identify the knee and inflection points on the total count curve.
- `emptyDrops()` is designed to distinguish between empty droplets and cells by testing each barcode’s expression profile for significant deviation from the ambient profile.
- `swappedDrops()` removes the effects of barcode swapping.
  It takes a list of paths to individual samples and returns a list with an item called `cleaned`, itself a list of sparse matrices, after removing swapped molecules.

# Empty droplets

```
]

.pull-right[
.x-large-list[
- To optimise the capture rate, the number of GEL beads is much higher than the number of cells.

- This leads to a higher probability of a cell and a bead ending up in the same droplet.

- However, this also leads to a large number of 'empty' droplets with just a bead and some ambient RNA or a dead cell.
]
]

---

# Empty droplets

Below is an example of a challenging cell-calling scenario mixing:

- 300 high RNA content 293T cells
- 2000 low RNA content PBMC cells

On the left is the cell calling result with the cell calling algorithm prior to Cell Ranger 3.0 and on the right is the current Cell Ranger 3.0 result. You can see that low RNA content cells are successfully identified by the new algorithm.

# Quality-control and preprocessing using Bioconductor

The package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scater")` provides several utilities focused on the preprocessing and quality control of single-cell gene expression data.

## Quality-control

- `perCellQCMetrics()` and `perFeatureQCMetrics()` compute a variety of quality control metrics for arbitrary sets of cells and features in the dataset (e.g., mitochondrial genes, individual samples).

## Normalisation

- `logNormCounts()` computes log-transformed normalized expression values.
  This includes the computation of size factors using `librarySizeFactors()`.

---

# scran: Methods for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis

The package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scran")` provides a range of methods focused on the normalisation and preprocessing of single-cell gene expression data.
Some examples are presented below.

.pull-left[
### Normalisation

- `computeSumFactors()` implements the deconvolution strategy from (Lun et al., 2016).

### Feature selection

- `modelGeneVar()` decomposes the log-expression profiles for each gene into technical and biological components based on a fitted mean-variance trend.
- `getTopHVGs()` uses modelling statistics `modelGeneVar()` to define a set of highly variable genes.
]

.pull-right[
### Clustering

- `quickCluster()` provides a convenient wrapper to quickly define clusters of a minimum size.

### Differential expression

- `findMarkers()` finds candidate marker genes for groups of cells (e.g., clusters).
]

# scran: Deconvoluting size factors from cell pools

.pull-left[
- All cells in the data set are averaged to make a reference pseudo-cell.

- Expression values for cells in pool A are summed together and normalized against the reference to yield a pool-based size factor.

- This is equal to the sum of the cell-based factors and can be used to formulate a linear equation.

- Repeating this for multiple pools leads to the construction of a linear system that can be solved to estimate the size factor for each cell

# Dimensionality reduction in Bioconductor

The package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scater")` provides wrappers for several common dimensionality reduction methods.
Those include:

.x-large-list[
- `scater::runPCA()`
- `scater::runTSNE()`
- `scater::runUMAP()`
]

## Important notes:

- Those methods generally use only a subset most variable features, not the entire dataset.
- By default, `runTSNE()` performs a PCA step first, the result of which the first 50 PCs are used as input for the t-SNE algorithm.
- By default, `runUMAP()` performs a PCA step first, of which the first 50 PCs are used as input into the UMAP algorithm.

---

# Cluster cells

The package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scran")` provides several methods for clustering single-cell data.

- `scran::quickCluster()` clusters similar cells using either log-expression values or ranks.
- `scran::buildSNNGraph()` builds a shared nearest-neighbour graph using cells as nodes.
  For each cell, its $k$ nearest neighbours are identified using the `findKNN()` function, based on distances between their expression profiles (Euclidean by default).
  + The function works on a reduced dimension representation of the dataset, _not_ the gene expression matrix.
  + The output is a graph where nodes are cells and edges represent connections between nearest neighbors.
    To obtain cluster, the graph must still be partitioned using an appropriate function, e.g. `igraph::cluster_louvain()`.

## Example

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
g <- buildSNNGraph(sce, use.dimred = 'PCA')
colData(sce)[["cluster_louvain"]] <- factor(igraph::cluster_louvain(g)$membership)
```

---

# Cluster markers

The package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scran")` provides several methods for identifying cluster markers.

- `scran::findMarkers()` tests for differential expression between pairs of groups.

- `scran::pairwiseTTests()` performs pairwise Welch t-tests between groups of cells, possibly after blocking on uninteresting factors of variation.
  The return value is a list of `DataFrame` - one for each group of cells - that can be examined separately of combined into a single table using `combineMarkers()`.

- `scran::pairwiseWilcox()` and `scran::pairwiseBinom()` provide alternative statistical tests.

---

# More single-cell methods available in Bioconductor

## scater

- `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scater")` includes a variety of convenient plotting functions (e.g. `plotReducedDim()`, `plotHeatmap()`)

## scran

- `scran::bootstrapCluster()` generates bootstrap replicates and reclusters on them to determine the stability of clusters with respect to sampling noise.
- `scran::cyclone()` implements the cell cycle classification step of the prediction method described by Scialdone et al. (2015).

# Exercise - A typical workflow using Bioconductor

1. Import the filtered matrix into R; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("DropletUtils")`.
  What can you tell about the raw data?

2. Compute and visualise quality control metrics; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scater")`.
  Would you remove any cell?

3. Convert the counts into normalized expression values to eliminate cell-specific biases (e.g., in capture efficiency); use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scater")` and/or `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scran")`.

4. Select features for downstream analyses, e.g. highly variable genes; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scran")`.

5. Apply dimensionality reduction to compact the data and further reduce noise; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scater")`.

6. Cluster cells; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scran")`.

7. Identify markers for each cluster; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scran")`.

8. At every step, take the time to _visualise_ results and relate them to the raw/normalised data; try `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("iSEE")`.

9. Bonus point: Import the raw matrix, and:

  + Identify and exclude empty droplets; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("DropletUtils")`.

  + Identify doublets; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scDblFinder")`.

???

Aim for <https://osca.bioconductor.org/overview.html#quick-start>

---

# Exercise step 1. Import the filtered matrix

- Import the filtered matrix into R; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("DropletUtils")`.

**Note:** use the `samples` argument of the `DropletUtils::read10xCounts()` function to give a convenient name to each sample.
  Check the difference without using the `samples` argument.

- Print a summary representation of the object.
  What can you tell about the contents of the object?

- What can you tell from the object metadata?

**Note:** slots of `SummarizedExperiment` objects are typically accessed using functions of the same name, e.g. `metadata()`.

---

# Exercise step 2. Quality control

- Compute and visualise quality control metrics; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scater")`.

**Note:** identify mitochondrial genes and pass those to the `subsets` argument of the `scater::addPerCellQC()` function.

**Note:** what is the return value?
  where are the quality metrics stored?
  what is the difference with `scater::perCellQCMetrics()`?

- Visualise quality metrics; use `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("ggplot2")`.

- Would you remove any cell?

**Note:** we have imported a matrix prefiltered by [Cell Ranger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger) using a certain set of criteria (which ones?); what other criteria can you think of, which may be useful for filterering cells?

- Similarly, use `scater::perFeatureQCMetrics()` or `scater::addPerFeatureQC()` to compute per-feature quality metrics, and visualise those metrics.

---

# Exercise step 3. Normalisation

- Convert the counts into normalized expression values to eliminate cell-specific biases (e.g., in capture efficiency); use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scater")` and/or `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scran")`.

**Note:** use `scater::logNormCounts()` to compute log-normalised counts.
  What is the return value?
  Where can you find the normalised counts?

- Plot the variance against the mean of each gene.

**Note:** how can you tell whether the normalisation was effective?
  Compare with https://osca.bioconductor.org/feature-selection.html#quantifying-per-gene-variation

---

# Exercise step 4. Feature selection

Select features for downstream analyses, e.g. highly variable genes; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scran")`.

- Use `scran::modelGeneVar()` to model the variance of the log-expression profiles for each gene.
  What is the output?

- Visualise the relation between the mean expression of each gene and the total / biological / technical variance of each gene.

**Note:** How do you interpret those different values?

- Use `scran::getTopHVGs()` to identify highly variable genes.

**Note:** what is the output?
  How many genes do you identify?
  Where are those genes located in the mean-variance plot?
  What happens to this plot if you set more stringent thresholds to define highly variable genes?

---

# Exercise step 5. Dimensionality reduction

- Use `scater::runPCA` to compact the data and further reduce noise.

**Note:** only give the set of highly variable genes to the `scater::runPCA()` function, to save time, memory, and to focus on biologically variable genes in the data set.

- Continue with UMAP or t-SNE.

**Note:** UMAP and t-SNE are typically given the output of PCA, to further reduce the dimensionality for ease of visualisation.

- Visualise the layout of cells produced by each of those dimensionality reduction methods.
  Considering coloring points with quality control metrics.

## Bonus point

- use `scran::denoisePCA()` to remove principal components that correspond to technical noise, and compare downstream t-SNE or UMAP with those obtained before de-noising.

---

# Exercise step 6. Clustering

- Use `scran::getClusteredPCs()` to cluster cells after using varying number of PCs and pick the number of PCs using a heuristic based on the number of clusters.

- Use `scran::buildSNNGraph()` and `igraph::cluster_louvain()` with the "ideal" number of PCs.

- Visualise the assigned cluster on your preferred dimensionality reduction layout.

**Note:** Dimensionality reduction and clustering are two separate methods both based on the PCA output.
  They may not always agree with each other, often helping to diagnose over- or under-clustering.

## Bonus point

- Test different numbers of principal components and compare results.

- Try `scran::quickCluster()`; identify key parameters and compare results.

# Exercise step 7. Cluster markers

- Use `scran::findMarkers()` to identify markers for each cluster.

- Visualise the expression of selected markers:

  + as a dot plot, optionally with a violin layer.
  
  + on a dimensionality reduction layout.

# Exercise step 8. iSEE

- Use `iSEE::iSEE()` to launch an interactive web-application to visualise the contents of the `SingleCellExperiment` object.

## Bonus point

- Preconfigure the application to start with a subset of panels, e.g.

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
iSEE::iSEE(sce, initial = list(
  ReducedDimensionPlot(PanelWidth=4L),
  RowDataTable(PanelWidth=8L)
))
```
