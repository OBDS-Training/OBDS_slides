# Exercise

## Import scRNA-seq data and create a SingleCellExperiment object

Input files are located in `/project/obds/shared/resources/4_r_single_cell/bioconductor_singlecell`.

- Import the filtered matrix into R; use `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("DropletUtils")`.

**Note:** use the `samples` argument of the `DropletUtils::read10xCounts()` function to give a convenient name to each sample.
  Check the difference without using the `samples` argument.

- Print a summary representation of the object.
  What can you tell about the contents of the object?

- What can you tell from the object metadata?

**Note:** slots of `SummarizedExperiment` objects are typically accessed using functions of the same name, e.g. `metadata()`.
