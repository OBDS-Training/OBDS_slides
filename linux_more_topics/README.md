# Genomics on the Linux command Line: Introduction to the Linux command line

<!--
This title should match exactly the link in the main README.
-->

## Data sets

<!--
Ideally, links to data sets that participants must download.
Even better, we add a page to this repository, that lists all data sets used; and this section links to some of those data sets.
Realistically, a list describing data sets that we will make them download on the day.
