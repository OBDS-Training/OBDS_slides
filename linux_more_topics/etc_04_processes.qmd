# Talk 1: Managing Linux processes and system resources

## Overview

- Linux processes
- Monitoring processes
- Terminating processes
- Monitoring disk usage

## Linux processes

- When you execute a Linux command, the shell session creates a process
- A process is a running instance of a program
- Every process has a process identifier (PID)
- During execution, a process changes from one state to another depending on its environment/circumstances
  + **Running** - process is running on the system
  + **Waiting** - process is waiting for an event to occur or for a system resource
  + **Stopped** - process has been stopped, usually by receiving a termination signal (either from user or system)
  + **Zombie** - process has been halted but it still has an entry in the table of processes

## Foreground and background processes

- By default, command executed interactively in the Bash session of a Terminal application are run in the **foreground**
  + A command running in the foreground will not return the prompt -- user cannot use the terminal until the command has finished running
  + **stdout** and **stderr** are printed on the terminal

## Foreground and background processes

- Processes can be run in the **background** to continue using the terminal while the they run
  + To run a command in the background, add an **ampersand '&'** to the end of the command
  + Best to prevent the process from printing to the terminal while running in the background -- redirect stdout and stderr to a file or suppress them
  + To move a foreground process to the background
    - Press Control + z to pause the process
    - Type 'bg' to send it to the background
    - Type 'fg' then Return key to bring the task back to the foreground

## Monitor processes with `jobs`

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Check how many processes you are running in the background

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-height: 50px
#| out-width: 500px
## Source: CCB Doks
knitr::include_graphics("img/jobs.png")
```

- In the `jobs` output 
  + '+' - job that would be brought to the foreground by default
  + '-' - second job that would be brought to the foreground by default
  
- If you have more than one process running in the background:
  + Type 'fg' followed by the integer number next to the command that you want to bring to the foreground (e.g. fg %2)

## Monitoring processes with `ps`

- Use `ps` (process status) to report a snapshot of the current processes

- Output of `ps` will always include at least two entries:
  + Bash process that is used to run the current Bash session
  + `ps` process itself, which is being being executed to snapshot currently running processes

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-height: 200px
#| out-width: 500px
## Source: CCB Doks
knitr::include_graphics("img/ps-sleep.png")
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

  + PID  - Process identifier (unique)
  + TTY  - Terminal type
  + TIME - CPU runtime
  + CMD  - Process name
  
:::

::::

```
$ ps -ef                  # Show all processes (-e) in the full format (-f)
$ ps -u <username>        # Show all processes for <username>
```

- `jobs` output is specific to the shell session while `ps` is more system-wide, able to return all processes

- When a processes has completed it will no longer appear in this process table

## Terminating processes with `kill` or `killall`

- Common reasons for terminating processes include:
  + Taking too long (e.g. froze, entered an infinite loop)
  + Using too many resources (e.g. memory, open file connections)
  + No longer functioning properly

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```
# Kills a specific process by process ID

$ kill <PID>

## Real-time monitoring with `top`

- Monitor processes and resource usage in real time
- Shows all processes running, not just yours
- Information is displayed as a table that can be filtered, for example to show processes for specific users, and sorted by different columns
- Above the table, a header displays system-wide information

<span style="color:green;">**Discuss further using exercise**</span>

```
$ top
```

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-height: 350px
#| out-width: 1000px

knitr::include_graphics("img/top_from_slide.png")
```

## Real-time monitoring with `htop`

- Improved and more user-friendly version of `top`, commonly installed on Linux computers
- Presents the same information as `top`, but in a more graphical and colour-coded way
 - Launches an interactive process viewer
 - Can use mouse and keyboard (f-keys) to interact with it

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-height: 450px
#| out-width: 900px
## Source: CCB Doks
knitr::include_graphics("img/htop-annotated.png")
```

##  Monitoring hard disk usage with `du`

- Frequently useful to know disk usage
  + HPC clusters often charge for disk space
  + They may use a quota system to limit disk usage

```
$ du -h             # Show directory space usage in human readable form
79K   ./slurm       # Works recursively showing usage in each subdirectory by default
8.2MB ./rnaseq
17M   .

$ du -hs            # Show total directory space usage in human readable form
17M   .
```

## Exiting the terminal

- You can exit the terminal in several ways:
  + logout, exit or Control+d
  + Loss of internet / VPN for remote sessions, power loss causing an unexpected outage of computing systems
Sends a hangup signal (HUP) to all dependent processes

  
- Existing sends a hangup signal (HUP) to all dependent processes
  + HUP signal prompts the session to terminate commands (including background processes) that are currently running, potentially resulting in lost work for users

## Resilience to loss of connection

- `nohup` command can be used to run a command that is immune to the HUP signal
  + Tells a process to ignore the hangup signal
  + By default, sends stdout to a file 'nohup.out'
  + By default, does not save stderr so should be explicitly redirected

```
# '&' commonly used with nohup to launch process in background
$ nohup <command> &

# > or 2> can be in any order
$ nohup wc -l file1.txt > stdout.txt 2> stderr.txt & 
```

# Talk 1 Exercise 1 - Linux processes & system resources

<!-- @sec-Talk1Exercise1 -->

## Talk 1 Exercise 1 â€“ Linux processes & system resources {#sec-Talk1Exercise1}

1. Start a new process in the foreground using the `sleep`.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sleep 300
```

2. Pause the process and send it to the background.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
# Control + z then
bg
```

3. Check the status of running processes.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
ps
jobs
```

4. Start a new sleep process in the background.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sleep 350 &
```

5. Kill the first process.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
ps # Or 
jobs -l # -l To additionally display PID

kill <PID>
```

6. Bring the second process to the foreground and terminate it.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
fg   # Then Control + c
```

7. Start 3 sleep (background) processes and kill them all by name using a single command.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sleep 300 & sleep 300 & sleep 300 & # Or just input separate lines
killall sleep
```

8. Look for all the processes for your username using `htop`.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
htop # Then type 'u', select username then press Return 
# To go back to original view, type 'u', select 'All users' then press Return
# F10 to quit htop
```

9. Sort the processes output by memory usage.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
htop # Then click on column header
```

10. Find the total memory usage, total tasks and running tasks on the server.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
# Information on top section (dynamic because info is real-time, no single answer)
htop 
```

11. Check the total disk usage in your home directory.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd ~ 
du -sh .
```
